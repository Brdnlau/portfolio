                <p class="indent project">This project was definitely one to commemorate. It introduced us to the process of app development and gave us creative freedom over our apps. The platform we used to develop our app was on <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor</a>. App inventor had an environment similar to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, but had unique features such as its own coding language, a live preview and the ability to utilize a mobile device’s functions. We were asked to build on from existing <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html" target="_blank">tutorials</a>, and to keep a <a href="files/App_Inventor_Project_Design_Notebook.pdf" target="_blank">project log</a> to document the progress we made. This project log consisted of our brainstormed ideas, a flow chart, and a time log. My partner, Apoorva Subramanian, and I worked diligently, dividing the work evenly and fairly. In the duration of this project, we added new aspects to the game such as: limited amount of bullets, a blue and purple balloon, and a leveling system. The most important concept I took away from this was the need to constantly run our code and make sure everything works the way we want it to. Brainstorming at the beginning of this project also led to our success, as coding with a clear objective in mind was much easier than making something up. </p>

                <p class="indent project">The Hangman project was probably my favorite project for the duration of our Python unit. The objective of this project was to mimic that of our favorite childhood game: Hangman. This project really introduced me to the complexity of coding since something as simple as the game Hangman is much much more difficult to code than to play. Besides some minor difficulties in creating a function that checked your guess with the secret word and displayed an output with lines or letters, everything else was pretty smooth. One of the things we did that contributed to the project’s success was our brainstorming at the beginning of this project. We thought of how Hangman worked and also had a plan of what features we wanted. We achieved all of these features, which made us all feel very much accomplished. Some of these features include ASCII art, a function that tells you if you’ve already guessed a word, life system, and a restarting function.</p>
