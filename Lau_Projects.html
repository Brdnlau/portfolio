                <p class="indent project">This project was definitely one to commemorate. It introduced us to the process of app development and gave us creative freedom over our apps. The platform we used to develop our app was on <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor</a>. App inventor had an environment similar to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, but had unique features such as its own coding language, a live preview and the ability to utilize a mobile device’s functions. We were asked to build on from existing <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html" target="_blank">tutorials</a>, and to keep a <a href="files/App_Inventor_Project_Design_Notebook.pdf" target="_blank">project log</a> to document the progress we made. This project log consisted of our brainstormed ideas, a flow chart, and a time log. My partner, Apoorva Subramanian, and I worked diligently, dividing the work evenly and fairly. In the duration of this project, we added new aspects to the game such as: limited amount of bullets, a blue and purple balloon, and a leveling system. The most important concept I took away from this was the need to constantly run our code and make sure everything works the way we want it to. Brainstorming at the beginning of this project also led to our success, as coding with a clear objective in mind was much easier than making something up. </p>

                <p class="indent project">The Hangman project was probably my favorite project for the duration of our Python unit. The objective of this project was to mimic that of our favorite childhood game: Hangman. This project really introduced me to the complexity of coding since something as simple as the game Hangman is much much more difficult to code than to play. Besides some minor difficulties in creating a function that checked your guess with the secret word and displayed an output with lines or letters, everything else was pretty smooth. One of the things we did that contributed to the project’s success was our brainstorming at the beginning of this project. We thought of how Hangman worked and also had a plan of what features we wanted. We achieved all of these features, which made us all feel very much accomplished. Some of these features include ASCII art, a function that tells you if you’ve already guessed a word, life system, and a restarting function.</p>

                <p class="indent project"> For our first project of the year, our knowledge of Java from the summer homework was put to the test. The objective was to create a game that had educational value in Greenfoot, an integrated development environment that allows for development of two-dimensional graphical applications. With climate change becoming one of today's leading issues, we thought it would be a good idea to make a game that addresses litter and how to sort them. Our game featured different concepts such as 2D arrays, random number generators, constructors and objects, as well as components like user input and control. Having previously coded mainly in Python, a relatively simpler language, using Java forced me to be more attentive towards other factors such as syntax. At its final stage, our game featured litter that rained down with a user-controlled avatar that moved left and right that collected them. After the collection, the user would be prompted to sort each of the objects they collected into the correct bin (recycle, trash or compost), with the game correcting them if they got it wrong. Our clear vision and planning of the game, paired with our understanding of Java helped make the game successful. We had all the features we wanted for a basic iteration of the game, but in the feature we would like to perhaps have more facts and other aspects to truely increase knowledge on the subject. </p>

                <p class="indent project"> This project doubled up as a learning experience. With about a dozen tutorial video on Android Studio, we were tasked with creating a basic app User Interface. Initially, my group and I were stuck, but after experimentation and going back tot he video tutorials, we were able to figure out the basics of Android Studio. After that, we found Android Studio to be very intuitive, as it auto generated the required XML files allowed preview of our app UI in a clean and concise way through the use of emulators or downloading directly onto our phones. Our app idea was to make an app that helps out small restaurants manage their customers and tables by having all of it on the app. We wanted a easy to use and fast interface that basically just allowed you to find a restaurant, see avaliable seats, queuing times and even book tables. Due to the nature of a skeleton app, we only have an interface and the app is barely function beyond that. I thought this project was successful in introducing us to Android Studio and application development from scratch.</p>
