                <p class="indent aboutme">Hello, my name is Brandon Lau and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. In this day and age, life is becoming easier and easier, thanks to technology. As a person born into the midst of this, my life has been influenced heavily by technology from an early age. This influence has led to my personal passion for anything related to technology or science based. Right now, I can turn this personal passion into so much more, such as achieving a career in mechatronics.</p>
                <p class="indent aboutme">I am currently taking Computer Science and Software Engineering, and have taken Introduction to Engineering Design. Both of these courses have a strong emphasis on teamwork and creativity from within. Through many projects over the course of these two years, I consider myself as charismatic, adaptive, and humorous. These qualities have led to the success of a recent project, requiring the harmonization of ideas and the synergy between members. I successfully led our team through many bumps from start to finish.</p>
                <p class="indent aboutme">Although I donâ€™t believe that laughter is the best medicine, I do believe that laughter is the best cure for that awkwardness when a group first comes together. Many members holdback ideas, with fear of rejection or embarrassment, even though this idea may probably be the best idea. With the absence of awkwardness and fear, synergy can be achieved, paving the way for a successful project. My goal in each group project is to contribute everything I have to the group, and make sure all members work together efficiently. With this mindset, I can confidently say that most of my group based projects are successful, and the initial goals set are achieved.</p>
